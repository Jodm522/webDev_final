    James Mayfield I've been web programming for over a decade now, and I
    decided I wanted this website to be a cheeky play on a basic website file
    structure. The colors are based on the VScode them Synthwave '82 Blues, and
    I decided to program the complex color changes in teh most brute force way
    imaginable instead of spending the requisite hours finding an elegant
    solution, leading to absolute span hell in every file, guaranteed! My
    biggest inspiration was the VS code editor, with Synthwave '82 Blues being
    another. I feel like I was successful in completing what I wanted to do, but
    the way I did it felt like recompense for every simple solution I've ignored
    in favor of brute force. If I were to do this again I'd rely more heavily on
    javascript to correctly format and color the text. The way I did it was a
    good exercise in patience and stubbornness, but I can think of better ways
    to while away the hours. If given teh chance to improve I'd probably add
    more pictures and videos. As it stands it makes sense with the theme, and I
    enjoy the minimalist approach, but it starts to go from minimalist to
    brutalist pretty quick.
